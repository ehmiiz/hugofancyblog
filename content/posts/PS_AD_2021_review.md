## 2021: From my IAM Perspective

First of all, this [blog-post](https://www.dowst.dev/2021-a-powershell-year-in-review/) inspired me to write something similar, so thanks [@MDowst](https://twitter.com/MDowst/) for sharing.

For myself I've been writing quite a few security focused modules and scripts to help me in my day-to-day life as an IAM Engineer. I've discovered the PowerShell community calls, and found a whole array of inspirational twitter-users to follow.

## 2021: Some cool stuff I found
- [PSReadLine](https://www.bing.com/search?q=psreadline+predictive+intellisense&cvid=941892197e824c9c996f36910a1dbb04&aqs=edge.0.0.6427j0j1&pglt=163&FORM=ANSPA1&PC=U531) and it's IntelliSense
- [GoPS](https://github.com/endowdly/GoPS) - a shell navigation module
- [PoshBot](https://poshbot.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
- [PowerShell Community Calls](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell-RFC/tree/master/CommunityCall)
- [Write-Info](https://github.com/Primycha/Write-Info) - a cool logging module
- [Windows terminal and it's split-tab functionality](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/terminal/panes)


## 2022 exciting stuff
Some stuff I'm personally excited about:
- Finish reading [PowerShell Cookbook](https://www.powershellcookbook.com/)
- Finish reading PowerShell In Action
- Developing more automation with [PowerShell 7 and Azure Automation](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/updates/azure-automation-powershell-7/#:~:text=Azure%20Automation%20support%20for%20PowerShell%207.1%20runbooks%20is,as%20hybrid%20jobs%20across%20Azure%20and%20non-Azure%20machines.)
- Implementing PowerShell logging / Protected logging
- Implementing a team oriented [PowerShellGet repo](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/gallery/how-to/working-with-local-psrepositories?view=powershell-7.2)
- Implementing SecretManegement/SecretStore/Az Keyvault on on-prem resources
- Attend the [PowerShell Community Calls](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell-RFC/tree/master/CommunityCall)
- Creating more useful modules for my team in general, as well as improving existing code
- Would love to contribute to the PowerShell repo this year, or publish some useful code to the PSGallery, to give back to the community

## Time flies

This year will be my 9th year of using and working with PowerShell, much have changed but mostly for the better.

I miss when ISE was the golden standard though, but hopefully VSCode will work more smoothly this year. I do appriciate the cross-platformness of VSCode, and the ability to export and import keybinds.

Would be awesome with a competitor to VSCode though, I would assume that some competition would not hurt for the end-user exp, let's see what happens.

## End with fire!

I'd like to end my blog-post with this old gem from [Lee Holmes](https://www.leeholmes.com/burn-console-optimized-and-ready-for-marshmallows/)
Still waiting for someone smart enough to re-write this for the Windows Terminal :)

Have a good one! 

### Happy coding
