# Hi, and welcome to my blog!
I'm a 28 year old guy who's writing this blog mostly to see how blogs can be built using GitHub and IaaS. And to remember what books I've read.

# Goals of this blog
* Simplicity
* Curiosity
* Positivity
* Digital bookshelf to look back on for myself
* Knowledge sharing

# [The making if the site](https://gohugo.io/)
This blog was build using Hugo-Extended, make sure to check it out if your interested in developing static sites with version-control and an easy build chain!
